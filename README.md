## Introduction

In this project, we implement a stock trading strategy using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to make live trades. We aim to predict the stock market's next-day trend based on historical data and create a strategy for trading Reliance Industries stock.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Sklearn (Support Vector Classifier)**: Sklearn is a machine learning library used for implementing the SVM model.
- **Yahoo Finance**: Historical stock data is obtained from Yahoo Finance.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is developed and presented in Jupyter Notebook.
- **BlueShift**: A platform for deploying and back-testing trading strategies.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **Warnings**: Used for ignoring warnings in the code.

## Step by Step Implementation

### Step 1: Import the Libraries

```python
# Machine learning 
from sklearn.svm import SVC 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score 

# For data manipulation 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 

# To plot 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
plt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid') 

# To ignore warnings 
import warnings 
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

We start by importing necessary Python libraries.

### Step 2: Read Stock Data

```python
# Read the csv file using read_csv  
# method of pandas 
df = pd.read_csv('RELIANCE.csv') 
```

We read historical stock data (OHLC format) of Reliance Industries from a CSV file downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

### Step 3: Data Preparation

```python
# Changes The Date column as index columns 
df.index = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']) 
# Drop the original date column 
df = df.drop(['Date'], axis='columns')
```

The data is prepared by changing the date column to the index and removing the original date column.

### Step 4: Define the Explanatory Variables

```python
# Create predictor variables 
df['Open-Close'] = df.Open - df.Close 
df['High-Low'] = df.High - df.Low 
# Store all predictor variables in a variable X 
X = df[['Open-Close', 'High-Low']]
```

We create predictor variables 'Open-Close' and 'High-Low' to be used for prediction.

### Step 5: Define the Target Variable

```python
# Target variables 
y = np.where(df['Close'].shift(-1) > df['Close'], 1, 0)
```

The target variable 'y' is defined based on whether the next day's closing price is higher (1) or lower (0) than the current day's closing price.

### Step 6: Split the Data into Train and Test

```python
split_percentage = 0.8
split = int(split_percentage*len(df)) 
# Train data set 
X_train = X[:split] 
y_train = y[:split] 
# Test data set 
X_test = X[split:] 
y_test = y[split:]
```

The data is split into training and test datasets.

### Step 7: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

```python
# Support vector classifier 
cls = SVC().fit(X_train, y_train)
```

We create a Support Vector Classifier model using the training data.

### Step 8: Classifier Accuracy

```python
# Calculate the accuracy of the classifier on the train and test dataset
train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, cls.predict(X_train))
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, cls.predict(X_test))
```

We calculate the accuracy of the algorithm on the training and test datasets.

### Step 9: Strategy Implementation

We predict buy/sell signals using the trained model and calculate strategy returns.

## Back-testing Results

We present back-testing results for stocks like TCS and ICICI Bank, showing how our strategy compares to stock returns over the last year.

## Deploying Strategy to Live Market

We discuss how the strategy can be deployed in live markets using platforms like BlueShift and the importance of back-testing.

## Conclusion

We conclude by emphasizing the promising returns of the strategy and the potential for further improvement through the use of additional technical indicators and advanced techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning in live trading.

*Note: Real money should not be deployed until comprehensive backtesting is performed and promising returns are demonstrated during paper trading.*
